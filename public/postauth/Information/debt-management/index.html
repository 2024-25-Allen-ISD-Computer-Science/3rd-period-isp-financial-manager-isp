                <h2>1. Pay More Than the Minimum Payment</h2>
                <p>Paying only the minimum balance on your debt prolongs repayment and increases the amount of interest you'll pay over time. Aim to pay more than the minimum whenever possible.</p>
                <div>
                    <p><strong>Statistic:</strong> According to a 2022 report by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), 44% of credit cardholders only make the minimum payment, leading to years of repayment and much higher interest costs.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="card-hover">
                <h2>2. Use the Debt Snowball Method</h2>
                <p>This method involves paying off your smallest debts first, while making minimum payments on larger debts. Once a smaller debt is paid off, you move the amount you were paying toward the next smallest debt.</p>
                <div>
                    <p><strong>Fact:</strong> This approach can provide a psychological boost and motivation as you see your smaller debts disappearing, leading to a sense of accomplishment.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="card-hover">
                <h2>3. Consolidate Your Debt</h2>
                <p>Consolidating multiple debts into one loan or credit card can simplify your payments and potentially reduce your interest rates. Look for low-interest balance transfer cards or personal loans for consolidation.</p>
                <div>
                    <p><strong>Statistic:</strong> A study by NerdWallet found that 38% of Americans with credit card debt have considered consolidation as a way to manage payments.</p>

            <div class="card-hover">
                <h2>4. Create a Budget and Stick to It</h2>
                <p>Track your income and expenses to identify areas where you can cut back and allocate more toward paying off your debt. A solid budget helps prioritize debt repayment over unnecessary spending.</p>
                <div>
                    <p><strong>Fact:</strong> According to the National Foundation for Credit Counseling, 40% of consumers don't have a written budget, which can lead to financial mismanagement.</p>

        <div class="card card-hover">
            <h2>5. Avoid New Debt</h2>
            <p>While paying off existing debt, avoid accumulating more. Use cash or debit cards instead of credit cards, and resist the urge to take on new loans while trying to eliminate existing balances.</p>
            <div>
                <p><strong>Statistic:</strong> A 2023 report by the Federal Reserve found that U.S. household debt rose to a record $17 trillion, highlighting the importance of avoiding new debt while paying off current balances.</p>

            <h2>How to Stay Out of Debt</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Set up an emergency fund to cover unexpected expenses without relying on credit.</li>
                <li>Avoid living beyond your means and focus on saving for larger purchases instead of financing them.</li>
                <li>Pay your bills on time to avoid late fees and damage to your credit score.</li>
                <li>Build and maintain a healthy credit score to access better loan terms if needed.</li>
            </ul>
            <div>
                <p><strong>Statistic:</strong> A report from Experian shows that nearly 1 in 3 Americans have no emergency savings, which can lead to credit card debt when unexpected expenses arise.</p>
